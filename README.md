PostgreSQL database that stores information on all World Cup games played, along with a Bash script for inserting data into the database and another script for querying the database.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a Bash script that can enter information from the World Cup games.csv file into the PostgreSQL database, and then query the database for useful statistics.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from the [games.csv](https://github.com/z-bj/Fifa_World_Cup_DB/blob/master/games.csv) file available in this repository.



## Database Building

The PostgreSQL database called 'worldcup' was created to store the data from games.csv. It contains two tables - 'games' and 'teams'. Primary and foreign keys were added as constraints to relate the tables.

The 'games' table tracks all matches and scores made by both the winner team and the opponent team using the team_id as the identifier. The 'teams' table lists all teams that played in the matches.

### View

You can view the initial_tables_creation.sql file to see how the database was created.

## PostgreSQL Data Querying Through Bash Script

The [insert_data.sh](https://github.com/z-bj/Fifa_World_Cup_DB/blob/master/insert_data.sh) script reads the games.csv file and inserts all its content automatically into the waiting table by calling the database. The Bash script inserts all winning and opponent teams individually into the 'teams' table and then into the 'games' table based on the team_id created.



The [queries.sh](https://github.com/z-bj/Fifa_World_Cup_DB/blob/master/queries.sh) script utilizes SQL to query the database and obtain useful values.

## Resources

A [DB dump](https://github.com/z-bj/Fifa_World_Cup_DB/blob/master/worldcup.sql) (post-insertion) is available in the worldcup.sql file.
